# Redux-TS
This project is meant to give a brief understanding of how to manage a Redux store in React using TypeScript. The goal 
was to make sure that the concepts are clear. There are multiple example projects in here that allow you to see the 
different use cases and what you have to go through when it comes to using TypeScript. I wanted this to be a reference
that I could use later on if need be in order to implement Redux in a project later. Please feel free to use this repo
as a reference or for practicing as well.
